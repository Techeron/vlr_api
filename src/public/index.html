                <p>
                    This website is an API for the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/">vlr.gg</a> website.<br />
                    It is a work in progress and is not complete.<br />
                    It is not affiliated with vlr.gg in any way.<br />
                    It is a personal project that I am working on to learn more about APIs and web development.<br />
                    If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to contact me on discord at <strong>BubblySpore#4126</strong>

            <details>
                <summary role="button" class="secondary">How Does this work?</summary>
                <h3>
                    <a href="/api">/api/:type/:id</a><br />
                </h3>
                <p>
                    For Example: <a href="/api/player/1337">/api/player/1337</a> will show details about Naga<br />
                    Types: <pre>event | events | player | team</pre><br />
                    WIP Types: <pre>players | teams | news</pre><br />
                    Id: the id of the player, team or event from the vlr.gg site<br />
                    Plural types will return an array of objects, while singular types will return a single object. <br />
                    <strong>Plural types do not need an id</strong><br/>
                    All requests made are get requests, and for now there is no caching system
                    so all data is pulled live from the site every time you make a request.
                    This is not ideal and will be changed in the future.
